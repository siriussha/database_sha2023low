This repository contains the data used in the paper titled ***"Low-frequency experimental method for measuring the electrical double layer capacitances of multi-cell electrolysis stacks based on equivalent circuit model"***.

The data is organized in '/raw', and the contents of the files are listed below:
- Step 1*.csv: UI curve test sequences in Step 1
- Step 2*.csv: UI curve test sequences in Step 2
- Step 3*.csv: SPC test sequences in Step 3
- EIS*.csv: EIS test results

The error bar plot can be found in the Supplementary Materials of the paper and in '/fig', while the experimental setup details are organized in Subsection 2.1 of the paper.

Codes to process raw data are also provided. Run 'main.m' in MATLAB to get processed data and to generate the figures in the Supplementary Materials.
